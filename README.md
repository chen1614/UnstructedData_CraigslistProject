# UnstructedData_CraigslistProject
Developed an auto-categorizing feature for Craigslist based on image and text classification algorithms. 
Due to the loose business operating model without strict management, Craigslist has been cumulating a large amount of unstructured data. With the pursuit of enhancing website usability and increasing customer satisfaction, Craigslist needs to implement the auto-categorization functionality in its ad post service. To deploy the auto-categorization feature for Craigslist, we developed text and image classification models for unstructured ad posting data.
